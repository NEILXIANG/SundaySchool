# Optional dependencies for the legacy dlib/face_recognition backend.
#
# Use only when you explicitly select:
#   - env: SUNDAY_PHOTOS_FACE_BACKEND=dlib
#   - or config.json: face_backend.engine = "dlib"
#
# Notes:
# - dlib can be hard to build on some platforms (especially Windows). Prefer prebuilt wheels when available.
# - This file is intentionally separate to keep the default install lightweight and teacher-friendly.

face_recognition>=1.3.0
# dlib wheels vary by platform; keep it unpinned.
