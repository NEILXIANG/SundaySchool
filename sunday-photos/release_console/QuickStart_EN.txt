Teacher Quick Start (macOS / Windows)

Only 3 steps:
1) Unzip
2) Put photos into input
3) Run, then check output

Step 1: Unzip
- Download and unzip to Desktop (recommended)

Step 2: Put photos into input
- input/student_photos/: student reference photos (1–5 per student; clear frontal face is best)
- input/class_photos/: class/event photos (all photos to organize)

Examples:
- input/student_photos/Alice_1.jpg
- input/student_photos/Alice_2.jpg
- input/student_photos/Bob_1.jpg
- input/class_photos/2025-12-25_Event_001.jpg

Step 3: Run (single entrypoint)
- macOS: double-click SundayPhotoOrganizer (or 启动工具.sh)
- Windows: double-click Launch_SundayPhotoOrganizer.bat
- A black window shows progress; do not close it

Where are the results?
- output/: organized results
- logs/: logs (if any issue, send the whole logs folder)

macOS security prompt (can’t be opened / developer cannot be verified)
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → find the blocked app message → Open Anyway → open again
- Or: right click SundayPhotoOrganizer → Open → confirm

If something goes wrong, send:
1) the whole logs/ folder
2) a screenshot of the error
