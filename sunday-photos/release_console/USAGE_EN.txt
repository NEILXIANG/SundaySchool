Sunday School Photo Organizer - Console Edition (English)

🚀 Quick Start (3 steps)
1) Double-click "SundayPhotoOrganizer" (or run ./SundayPhotoOrganizer in Terminal).
2) When prompted, place photos into the input/ folder created next to the app.
3) Run the app again to process; the output folder opens automatically.

📁 Folders created on first run (next to the app)
- The app automatically creates input/, output/, and logs/ next to itself.
- input/student_photos: Reference photos (folder-only): input/student_photos/<student_name>/... (filenames can be anything).
- input/class_photos: Classroom photos. Prefer date subfolders (2024-12-21/group.jpg). jpg/png supported.
- output: Sorted results, organized by student → date.
- logs: Run logs; safe to clear.

📸 Photo prep tips
- Provide at least 1 clear, frontal reference photo per student; 2-3 help accuracy.
- Avoid blurry or side profiles in classroom photos when possible.

💡 Run notes
- If the app exits immediately, it likely found no photos—add reference + classroom photos then rerun.
- Re-run anytime; it will continue organizing newly added classroom photos.
- After processing, the output folder opens automatically.

❓ FAQ
- Finishes too fast: Check the `Work folder` path shown in the console and verify folder names and photo placement.
- Work folder location: By default, input/output/logs are created next to the app. If that location is not writable, it falls back to Desktop (or Home). Use the printed `Work folder` path as the source of truth.
- Poor matches: Add more clear reference photos for that student.
- Won't launch (macOS): If blocked, allow "Open Anyway" in Privacy & Security.
